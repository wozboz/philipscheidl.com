## How I automatically water my plants - with Home Assistant and an ESP8266

## Intro

Story about why autowatering, why selfbuilt, goals of the project.

My girlfriend and I had a 16 day vacation coming up, and I stood in front of a problem: what do I do with the plants on our balcony? You could either bother someone with the task of watering them at least once daily - or you could automate it. That second thought spoke much more to my inner nerd, and it seemed like a good project to take on. Of course, I could have gone the easy route and just bought some pre-built system, but they lacked a few things that were essential to me:
- Integration with Home Assistant
- Vendor-agnostic, meaning I could repair it myself
- Not connected to any third-party cloud service - I think the long list of disasters that we have had in this regard make this pretty understandable ***(CITATION NEST, CLOUD SERVICE STOPPED ETC.)***
- Solar-powered

So now, I started into the research part of the project, trying to understand what would be needed to actually fulfil these requirements.



## Explanation of idea / Goals
Solar panel, terrace, compatible with HA, no pre-built solution, no cloud, first plan in Fritzing, show different sources (heschner.at etc.)

After reading quite a few articles and posts on the internet, I realised one thing very quickly: lots of people have had the same idea, and it was not going to be easy. I will not take you on the journey of everything I read through, but I do have to credit a few articles and sites that helped bring me on the right track. The most useful one surprisingly came from a fellow countryman ***(HERSCHNER LINK). INSERT OTHER LINKS***

Finally, I came up with the following component list and schematic. Feel free to use it and change it for your own needs:

## Execution of the project
### Soldering of components
How I learned soldering/First time soldering, how I tested before soldering etc., crimp cables, how to solder cables

### Programming of ESP
Github source for code, what I changed

### HA integration
MQTT integration, Automation I use, testing with click of relay

## First testrun

## Conclusion

What have I learned? What could I improve?
